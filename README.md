  <span>This application contains a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) tool designed specifically for macOS. The tool analyzes network traffic and inspects data packets to provide insights into the flow of information across the network. It is useful for network administrators, security professionals, or anyone looking to monitor and inspect network traffic in detail.</span>

<h1>❔ How it works</h1>

###

<h2>HTTP</h2>

Since most websites in the world now support HTTPS, MacDPI doesn't bypass Deep Packet Inspections for HTTP requests, However, it still serves proxy connection for all HTTP requests.

<h2>HTTPS</h2>

Although TLS encrypts every handshake process, the domain names are still shown as plaintext in the Client hello packet. In other words, when someone else looks on the packet, they can easily guess where the packet is headed to. The domain name can offer significant information while DPI is being processed, and we can actually see that the connection is blocked right after sending Client hello packet. I had tried some ways to bypass this and found out that it seemed like only the first chunk gets inspected when we send the Client hello packet split into chunks. What MacDPI does to bypass this is to send the first 1 byte of a request to the server, and then send the rest.
